## Abstract

We prove that minimal instanton bundles on a Fano threefold x of Picard rank one and index two are semistable objects in the Kuznetsov component Ku (x), with respect to the stability conditions constructed by Bayer, Lahoz, Macrı and Stellari. When the degree of x is at least 3, we show torsion free generalizations of minimal instantons are also semistable objects. As a result, we describe the moduli space of semistable objects with same numerical classes as minimal instantons in Ku (x). We also investigate the stability of acyclic extensions of non-minimal instantons.
