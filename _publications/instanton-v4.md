## Abstract

We study semistable sheaves of rank 2 with Chern classes c1=0, c2=2 and c3=0  on the Fano threefold V4 of Picard number 1, degree 4 and index 2. We show that the moduli space of such sheaves is isomorphic to the moduli space of semistable rank 2, degree 0 vector bundles on a genus 2 curve. This also provides a natural smooth compactification of the moduli space of Ulrich bundles of rank 2 on V4.
