## Abstract

Via wall-crossing, we study the birational geometry of Beauville-Mukai systems on K3 surfaces with Picard rank one. We show that there is a class of walls which are always present in the movable cones of Beauville-Mukai systems. We give a complete description of the birational geometry of rank two Beauville-Mukai systems when the genus of the surface is small.
