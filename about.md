## Who I Am

Hi! I'm **Qin Xuqiang**, an AI researcher and mathematician passionate about exploring the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical theory. My work focuses on understanding how mathematical structures can inform and improve machine learning systems, and how AI can advance our understanding of complex mathematical problems.

With a background spanning both pure mathematics and applied AI research, I bring a unique perspective to problems in modern artificial intelligence. I'm particularly enthusiastic about:

- 🧠 **Deep Learning & Neural Networks** - Developing and analyzing architectures that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing** - Creating systems that truly understand and generate human language
- 📐 **Mathematical Foundations of AI** - Exploring the theoretical underpinnings that make intelligent systems work
- 🤝 **Collaborative Research** - Working with others to solve challenging problems in AI and mathematics

## My Journey

My path into AI research has been driven by a deep curiosity about how intelligent systems work and a love for mathematical elegance. I've had the privilege of working on problems that span from pure mathematical theory to practical machine learning applications.
