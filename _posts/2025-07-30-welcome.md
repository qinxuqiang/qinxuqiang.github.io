Welcome to my newly redesigned personal website! This is an exciting milestone as I launch this platform to share my thoughts, research, and projects with the broader community.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a space where I explore topics at the intersection of:

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** - Latest techniques, research insights, and practical applications
- **Natural Language Processing** - Deep dives into language models and text understanding
- **Mathematics** - Theoretical foundations and their connections to AI
- **Research & Projects** - Updates on my work and explorations

## Why This Blog?

I believe in open science and knowledge sharing. Through this blog, I hope to:

1. Document my learning journey and research insights
2. Share practical techniques and code examples
3. Connect with other researchers and practitioners
4. Contribute to the broader AI and mathematics community
